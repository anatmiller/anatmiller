💼  I have a strong background in system design and have worked on high-scale systems that require a deep understanding of how software works under the hood.
     I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others and helping them unlock the power of code and system design. 

🚀 I'm always eager to learn new technologies and explore new ways of solving complex problems. 
    I'm constantly updating my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in software development. 

🌟 I'm a firm believer in knowledge sharing and love helping others grasp complex software concepts 
   and expand their knowledge. 
   I enjoy building things and creating systems like Lego from building blocks.

👾 Fun fact: Python's name isn’t derived from the snake, but from the British comedy series "Monty Python’s Flying Circus"! Guido van Rossum, Python's creator, chose the name because he was a fan of the show and wanted the language to be fun to use.
