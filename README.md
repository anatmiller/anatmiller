My name is Anat Miller,

I'm a passionate Senior Engineer interested in Software development.

and have a strong passion for assisting others in grasping complex software concepts and expanding their knowledge, I love technology and I am updated with all of the newest trends.


💬 Ask me about: 
     Python, CPP, System design in very high-scale.         

⚡ Fun fact: Python's name isn’t derived from the snake, but from the British comedy series "Monty Python’s Flying Circus"! Guido van Rossum, Python's creator, chose the name because he was a fan of the show and wanted the language to be fun to use.
